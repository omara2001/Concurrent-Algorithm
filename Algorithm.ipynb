The hash set can be implemented using a bit array, which takes up significantly less memory than a traditional array. Then, we can generate random integers and check if they are present in the hash set. If an integer is not present in the hash set, we can return it as the result. This algorithm has a complexity of O(1) for each integer generation, since we can check the presence of an integer in the hash set in constant time using a hash function."
